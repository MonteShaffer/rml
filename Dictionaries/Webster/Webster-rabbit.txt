Typhoid fever, also called enteric fever, is caused by salmonella bacteria.

Causes
A bacteria strain called Salmonella enterica serotype typhi causes typhoid fever. Other strains of salmonella bacteria cause a similar disease called paratyphoid fever.

People pick up the bacteria most often in places where outbreaks are common. The bacteria passes out of the body in the stool and urine of people who are carrying the bacteria. Without careful hand-washing after going to the bathroom, the bacteria can move from the hands to objects or other people.

De la prostitution dans la ville de Paris (Prostitution in the City of Paris), an early 1830s study on 3,558 registered prostitutes in Paris, written by Alexander Jean Baptiste Parent-Duchatelet (published in 1837, a year after he died), has been called the first work of modern sex research.[2]

In England, the founding father of sexology was the doctor and sexologist Havelock Ellis who challenged the sexual taboos of his era regarding masturbation and homosexuality and revolutionized the conception of sex in his time. His seminal work was the 1897 Sexual Inversion, which describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys.

The French philosopher and historian Michel Foucault argued that Victorian sexual repression was a myth, that instead of a silence there was a proliferation of discourses about sex.

The French philosopher and historian Michel Foucault argued that Victorian sexual repression was a myth, that instead of a silence there was a proliferation of discourses about sex. Medical doctors, psychiatrists and sexologists obsessively categorised sexual variations. But Hera Cook argues that sexual repression was a reality. She does not see sexual desire as a natural force that was suppressed; rather, if sex was constructed, people had to learn about sex and, if the only messages they received were negative, sexual expression would be inhibited. In fact, she argues, abstinence was an important means of birth control just about until the invention of the pill. ‘I have a headache tonight, dear’, was a way middle-class women refused to have too many children (Hera Cook, The Long Sexual Revolution: English Women, Sex and Contraception 1800-1975, Oxford University Press, 2004).

Jeremiah 1.

The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah.  A house of priests that were in Anathoth (son of Becher and grandson of Benjamin) in the land of Benjamin. [A levitical town in the tribe of Bejnamin where Jeremiah was bordn [h6068]]

Called in the days of Josiah, in the 13th year of his reign.  

King Amon was assassinated, Josiah was King at 8. [servants or officials killed him] ... Josiah was a puppet?  Amon was in-league with Assyria.  Committed incest with mother?  destroyed temples (being repaired under Josiah)

... married Jedidah ... became king at 22, died at 24 ... that would mean he sired Josiah at 16

Jedidiah was the name of Solomon ... beloved of Jehovah

Josiah is 21 (born 648) ... who called Jeremiah (politics?)

Two wives ... Zebudah and Hamutal

Z had Johanan and Eliakim (1


Hilkiah (Jeremiah's dad) finds a book of the law in the temple during the early stages of the renovation. ... scroll to his secretary Shaphan would took it to the king ... [why not directly]

The story is that King Josiah hid the Ark (knowing of the national catastrophe) ... JCU Jewish Culture Unintelligable

Egypt/Assyria were aligned to fight Babylon ... Josiah intercedes ... 

Shallum (renamed Jehoahaz) ... Josiah 16 when sired
Two years younger than Eliakim ... josiah 14 when sired 

[Johanan, josiah 12?]
The firstborn of King Josiah through Zebudah his wife. He is briefly mentioned in the Hebrew Bible only in the Book of 1 Chronicles. He could possibly be the same as Jehoahaz of Judah. ???

Jeremiah 22:10 is Jeremiah (11/12 is deutor added)


#### WIKI Talk Josiah
Josiah had two wives of certain genelogies.  Two sons of those wives.

Johanan seems to be the oldest? Where is he in the succession?

The article says the youngest son Shallum was placed on the thrown.  Zedekiah is the youngest son by 15 years!

Zedekiah was the second-born of Hamutal, but the fourth born of everyone.

If I do my maths correctly, Josiah was 12, 14, 15, 30 when he had Johanan, Eliakim, Shallum, Zedekiah. [Jeremiah comes onto the scene when Josiah is 21]

Which mother was the Queen mother and which was the Consort mother?  Which mother had ties to Babylon (if any)?  Which mother had ties to Egypt (if any)?

It seems like Egypt deposing Shallum is and indication of which mother they were aligned with politically?

https://www.bibletales.online/jeremiah-family-trees/














3 months later, Egypt is like: what?  Places older brother as king (Eliakim ==> Jehoiakim) and takes Shallum to Egypt never to return (Jeremiah laments).... WTF, younger brother, Jeremiah's doing? (Jer 22:10) ... is this not Mulek or Lehi?

1 Chr 3:15 Johana (firstborn, Jehoiakim [son Jeconihah], Zedekiah, Shallum).... Shallum was placed first ...
